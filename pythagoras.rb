# Pythagoras 📐
# Read two positive numbers a and b (one per line). They are the legs of a right triangle.
# Compute the hypotenuse c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and print it with `pp`, rounded to 2 decimals.
#
# Examples:
#   Input: 3, 4  -> 5.0
#   Input: 2, 2  -> 2.83
#
# Hints:
# - Use ** for squaring: a**2
# - Use Math.sqrt(...)
# - Round with round(2)
